> One thing that's causing some considerable delays to this project is that <X> is not as responsive as I would expect.
I haven't been able to reach him at all this morning. It's not uncommon that it takes him one or two hours to respond to a message on Slack or to act on a code review, if not more. This makes tasks that would be concluded within a few hours extend to a few days, because of the slowness of the cycle for feedback and actual changes being implemented.
I don't know how I can address this problem with him directly, and I also don't think I'm in a position to do so. I thought it was better to escalate this to you

my response:

but first thing address this asap, you might be uncomfortable but try to be honest about what you are observing and how it is slowing you down in return. try to do this today itself. these things should not be delayed. let me know how it goes and i will address tomo during my 1:1 with him.
then you will hear his side of the story. and then you both come to negotiations around
agreeing on a time to catch up
having an end-of-day async updates on where you both might have left and what's pending or rollover to the next day. this is not a must or doesn't have to be done everyday, but when working on urgent things such status updates will be very helpful to be on the same page next day
understanding urgency to respond to slack message or code review - during core working hours this should be less than an hour or something you both can agree and commit to.
when not working or have to run errands, update on slack or notify you, etc. for transparency.
ask him if anything's blocking him and how you could help him
you are now a sub-team, so you might want to see and establish these basic working agreements

> alright, thank you for the pointers. This is tricky for me because the hierarchy of this subteam is not so clear to me, and I wasn't seeing myself in the position of giving this type of feedback about the way he works

i will do the job of giving concrete feedback. since you 2 work closely, you need to first discuss this with him because this is also part of working in teams. what you would be doing is talking to him and expressing your concerns.
delivering the feedback and understanding his side of things is what i will do in detail and then will share with both of you

> thank you for clarifying. This makes me feel more comfortable and helps me understand better my part in this
