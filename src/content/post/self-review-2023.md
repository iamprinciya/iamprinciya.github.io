Overall: strong engineering leadership, organizational skills, project management, collaboration, and a strong bias towards action.

I have been focused on building and fostering a high-performing diverse team and our ability to deliver Anaconda Server to the market has considerably increased. I have also developed a strong cross-team relationship between engineering, product, and internal stakeholders directly impacting our internal collaboration, implementation engineering support, and customer experience.

Ana-can-do 2022 award nominee for “Empathy & Connection”.

As a manager empathy and connection are implicit job requirements that I exemplify the most. Given that I have to choose one core value set, I choose humility and ability, i.e. excellent collaboration inside and outside of the team, building others, and having an authentic leadership style.

On a personal level, I constantly strive to stay up to date and master hard and soft skills to deliver value for my job role.

---

Looking at the leadership competency framework, I do believe I am doing a good job towards:
- setting direction
- fostering play
- generating results.

However, on a personal level, I would like to focus more on innovation, to be able to drive innovative solutions that will drive business revenue.

Overall, I am extremely proud of having had the opportunity to build and grow a diverse team from scratch here at Anaconda and put Anaconda Server on a predictable release schedule.

A lot has happened over the last 6 months. I believe I have fared exceptionally well in communication and collaboration, being strategic and pragmatic, and having a strong bias toward action.

One of my core strengths is being strategic. Having a clear strategy around the way we want to execute things has always helped here, thereby PSP team being able to deliver in a timely manner. While navigating through 2 re-org, I have kept the team aligned around our priorities and release deliverables. During the re-org, I have been able to set directions and navigate through changes for myself and the team. I was able to deal with conflict management and work towards setting expectations and highlighting gaps thereby keeping things on track and accountable for the product and engineering leadership team.

The effort to build our repository solutions around a single repository core (repo-core) effort was underway before the Chimera PoC was presented. We strategized the repo-core topics and were able to have repo-core support SBOM hosting and migrate all repo-core microservices to support the S3 protocol for storage. These repo-core changes happened in parallel to Anaconda Server's quarterly releases.

Outside of Anaconda Server and the PSP team, I am also proud to have worked on revamping our tech hiring strategy and introducing a new technical interview round, i.e. "working with existing code" from start to finish. This involved working with engineering leadership and recruiters.

Other notable things that I worked on during the course of the last 6 months:

- Co-organised the product technology townhall in Q3
- ask-anaconda-server slack rotational PSP commander and bridged gaps with the implementation team. Engineering support for the Implementation team gradually improved and we were able to manage the implementation team's blockers and priorities better.
- Mentored, grew direct reports, and worked on 2 promotion cases.
- We had team offsite sessions and overall built psychological safety for the team.
- Hackdays winner in Q3 (Exponential Potentiator award for Anaconda Server QnA Base) and Q4 (The Spirit award for Microfrontends).
- Security audit setup with Snyk for Anaconda Server together with the QA automation and security team. (This was the initial phase when the security team was bootstrapped.)

Side projects I undertook inside and outside of Anaconda during the course of the last 6 months:

- Wrapped up the Women Who Code fellowship with excellent positive feedback from the community for leading the frontend chapter.
- Frontend to Serverless: workshop presented at Web Summer Camp, Croatia. Also presented this piece in one of the demo Friday sessions.
- Cofounded the "level-up" support group to offer a space for underrepresented gender level-3s at Anaconda to have community and support to pursue their path to become level-sr.
- Worked on a "role model story" for Anaconda's education outreach efforts for UT Austin’s Women in STEM Summer Externship Program.

I have learned the most from the following situations:

- Anaconda Server v6.3 release: This release was scheduled for the end of Q3 but got delayed by ~2 weeks. We did a root cause analysis for this and the lessons learned were helpful for us as a team to perform better, define priorities and set expectations going forward.
- Environment manager topic: The work was paused mid-way when we realized we had to prioritize product stabilization over building new features. The lessons learned from the delayed v6.3 release were also crucial in our being able to raise this issue in one of the QBR meetings and collectively decide to pause work on this topic.
- Product development strategy: This is the most important lesson to improve on where it is important for us as a leadership team to be accountable for all the decisions and directions that were set last year and be able to align with internal stakeholders.

Overall areas for improvement based on the 6-month reflection:

- Present with confidence at executive-level meetings such as QBR or other SLT/leadership level meetings: While I am ok in general to present at meetings, I need to be more confident while presenting tech strategy or business outcomes in these meetings. This needs me to understand in-depth about the niche problems we want to solve, competitor analysis, revenue impact, etc. On the technical side, this needs an in-depth understanding of Anaconda's product ecosystems, the historical context, etc. This is the area I am interested to grow towards and I believe if I get better at it would definitely help in impacting the business and my career growth.

I would have grown and matured in my leadership role and be responsible for scaling the engineering organization that would be a successful business area. I would either be the VP or the CTO of the unit depending on Anaconda's growth.

I would see myself as an impactful leader inside and outside of Anaconda. I would be speaking at conferences and writing blog posts about technical & non-technical challenges, and lessons learned while being part of a crucial growth phase at Anaconda.

My skill sets would be a powerful blend of technical and business topics that would help in generating revenue in niche and innovative areas.

---

- I would like us to have a strong product vision and technical strategy to help us within this enterprise organization. I want to focus on being an excellent partner to my product peers to help us achieve this goal.
- I want us to take the right measures to organize teams into engineering workstreams.

I want to focus on anything and everything that will help me to address my existing gaps to achieve the above results and for us to be able to deliver quality software.

For my current role:

It takes time to build trust and a working relationship with one's manager after a reorg. While we are in the phase of storming within the new org, I want my manager to know me, my strengths, and my background and be trusted with broader initiatives. I do have a sense of disconnectedness within the org and my org peers.

For my career/development:

I would like to be included in strategic growth discussions and get continuous feedback on areas to improve and get better at. I want to work on innovative and niche topics and be able to present them at executive-level meetings for which I will have to find the time to work and get visibility on the areas that I would be working on.
I am very ambitious when it comes to my personal career development and I believe I have the right mindset to work hard. I would need my manager's trust and support to be able to get to the next level.
