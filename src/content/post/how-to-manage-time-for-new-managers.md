no haven't chatted with others. but from what and how much you are doing, i can easily tell that managing time is important. you won't realise this in the beginning, because you will enjoy and all this is new. but eventually you will start feeling the stress. so it is better to be mindful to yourself as a first step.
the thing about visibility you are pushing, is the right thing. people need to be aware about how much you (and the team) are doing.
the other thing is that not sure if you still have the time to write code. because you are doing so many things, so you might want to reflect to yourself about how much time you want to be spending between managing and IC work, that balance is something you need to define for yourself, communicate it clearly to others and also make peace or compromise to yourself that you like it. for ex: if you want to spend more time for coding, then delegate some of the management/collaboration work to others, or if you want to do more of collaboration then try to spend less time on coding. this is the challenging part, and you will always end up spending extra time to code or review others PRs etc, because this part is something you know you are good at. but over time you need to consider this as work and make sure you don't spend the extra free time in evenings/weekends to write code or review others PRs.
I am sure you will do great, but keep in mind about the time and that you too need to take breaks and don't have to do everything yourself and end up burning out.
